## Introduction

Freerouting is a powerful PCB autorouter compatible with any PCB design software that supports the standard Specctra or Electra DSN interface. It imports `.dsn` files generated by the host system's Specctra interface and exports `.ses` Specctra session files.

## Getting started

You can interact with Freerouting using the Graphical User Interface ([GUI](#graphical-user-interface-gui)), the Command Line Interface ([CLI](#command-line-interface-cli)), or the Freerouting [API](#freerouting-api). All interfaces support command-line arguments to set input/output files or modify settings.

Integrations are available with:

- [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/)
- [Autodesk EAGLE](http://eagle.autodesk.com/)
- [Target3001!](https://ibfriedrich.com/en/index.html)
- [EasyEDA](https://www.easyeda.com/)
- [tscircuit](https://tscircuit.com/)
- [pcb-rnd](https://www.pcb-rnd.com/)

[Click here for more details](docs/integrations.md).

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

1) **Launch Freerouting**: Upon launching, you'll see the main interface.

2) **Open Your Design**: Go to `File` > `Open...` and select your `.dsn` input file.

3) **Start Autorouting**: Click the `Magic Wand` icon to begin the autorouting process.

4) **Monitor Progress**: Watch the routing progress visually in the board editor and numerically in the footer.

5) **Completion**: Wait for the autorouter to finish all passes. This may take from a few minutes to several hours.

6) **Save Your Routed Board**: Go to `File` > `Save as...` to save your routed board as a `.ses` file.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

When using the CLI, you'll work with an input file (e.g., Specctra `.dsn`) exported from your EDA tool. Freerouting will autoroute unconnected nets and save the results for re-import into your EDA (e.g., as a Specctra `.ses` file).

Common command-line arguments:

- `-de [design input file]`: Load a Specctra design file (`.dsn`) at startup.
- `-do [design output file]`: Save a Specctra session file (`.ses`) after routing.
- `-l [language]`: Set the language (e.g., `en` for English, `de` for German).
- `-inc [net class names]`: Ignore specified net classes during routing.
- `-help`: Display help information.

**Example Command:**

```bash
java -jar freerouting-2.0.0.jar -de MyBoard.dsn -do MyBoard.ses -inc GND,VCC
```

This command routes `MyBoard.dsn`, ignores the `GND` and `VCC` net classes, and outputs `MyBoard.ses`.

For more details (including headless mode), see the [CLI documentation](docs/command_line_arguments.md).

### Freerouting API

Freerouting offers public API endpoints for PCB routing. The API root is `https://api.freerouting.app/v1`. Check the service status at [`/system/status`](https://api.freerouting.app/v1/system/status).

To access full functionality, request access on the [Freerouting website](https://www.freerouting.app/).

Please note that the Freerouting API and [its documentation](docs/API_v1.md) are in beta and may change.

## Running Freerouting using Java JRE

Installers are available for Windows x64, Linux x64, and macOS. For other systems, you can run the platform-independent `.jar` file if you have Java JRE installed.

**Steps:**

1. **Download the JAR File**: Get the latest `.jar` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting/releases).

2. **Install Java JRE**: Download and install [Java JRE](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/).

   - Choose your operating system and architecture.
   - Select `JRE` as the package type.
   - Choose version `21`.

3. **Run Freerouting**:

   ```bash
   java -jar freerouting-2.0.0.jar
   ```

   **Note for macOS Users**: Launch Freerouting from the Terminal; starting from Finder is not supported.
